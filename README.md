**EEE3088 Power Sub-system Project 
MTHSEK006 & MKFMOR011**

**Description**  

This project involves the development of the micro-mouse power sub-system. The power sub-system is used to power the entire micro-mouse. There are eight requirements in total. These requirements will be equally divided between MTHSEK006 and MFKMOR011. MTHSEK006 requirements designs can be found under pearl_pcb_design branch and MFKMOR011 requirements design can be found under morena_pcb_design. At the end of the project, the power sub-system should be able to integrate with other components of the micro-mouse which include the motherboard, processor, sensing unit and the microcontroller.

**Structure**  

* PCB_v2.1: This includes the final PCB design. Contains Kicad files. 
* PCB_v2: This is the intial PCB design. Contains Kicad files.
* Documents: This includes footprints, symbol libraries, datasheets and project documentation. 
* Production: Contains the gerber, clp and bom files.

**Usage**

  * The files needed to produce this PCB are found under Production. This folder can be downloaded and directly used for production.  
  * The final PCB design can be viewed by downloading PCB_v2.1 and opening the project in Kicad.
